All the monks would gather at one common place. <br>
Then every monk would look around and see how may marks are present on the remaining monks. <br>
If he sees 14, he himself has a mark on his head, and if he sees 15 then he doesn't have a mark on his head. <br>
Thus every monk knows whether he has to jump or not!
