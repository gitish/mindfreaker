Once God was unhappy with the humans and decided to bring destruction upon the world. <br>
A group of 100 monks decided to go and plea to God for his mercy. After consideration, God decided that would be merciful upon the world, given the following condition:
When the monks would wake up the next morning, 15 monks will have a mark upon their forehead. The monks cannot see if there is a mark on their forehead nor can they communicate with each other. <br>
The 15 monks who have the mark on their forehead are all supposed to jump off a cliff and take a leap of faith. If only those 15 monks which have the mark on their forehead jump off the cliff, mankind will be spared. <br>
If even one monk which doesnâ€™t have the mark on his head jumps, then the world will be destroyed.
<br><br>How will a monk decide if he has a mark on his head or not, and thus decide whether he has to take the leap of faith?
