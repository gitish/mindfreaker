Answer : 13 races
<ol>
<li>	Divide 45 horses into 9 groups of 5 horses each; conduct a race amongst each group (total 9 races till now). Let’s say winners for each group be called a1,a2… a9. (total races =9)</li>
<li>	Have a race between say a1 to a5, (let the top 3 finishers be b1,b2 and b3) (total races =9+1=10)</li>
<li>	Have a race between b1 and a6,a7,a8 and a9. (total races =11). Let the top 3 be c1,c2,c3. (now you have fastest horse (c1).</li>
<li>	have a race between 2nd from c1 group, + b1 (if b1 didn’t win in race 11 else b3), b2 + c2, c3. Winner is second fastest horse (call it d1).</li>
<li>	Now pick, 3rd finish from c1 group, runner up from d1 group, plus b1(or b2 or b3, whoever remains) and c2 (or c3 whoever remains). Winner will be third fastest horse.</li>
