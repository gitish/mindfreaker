Consider the holes to be A , B , C , D , E<br>
Assume the person starts from an Odd Place. So he was either at A,C, or E.<br>
Hence next turn he will be at B or D.<br>
<br>
Day 1. Check B<br>
<br>
If he was at B he will be caught, else he is at D.<br>
Hence next day he will be at C or E<br>
<br>
Day 2. Check C<br>
<br>
If he was at C he will be caught, else he's at E. Hence next day he will be at D<br>
<br>
Day 3. Check D<br>
<br>
If he started from an Odd place, then he will be caught. If he isn't, that means he started at B or D. Also means next turn he will be at B or D.<br>
<br>
Day 4. Check B<br>
<br>
If he was at B he will be caught, else he is at D.<br>
Hence next day he will be at C or E<br>
<br>
Day 5. Check C<br>
<br>
If he was at C he will be caught, else he,s at E. Hence next day he will be at D<br>
<br>
Day 6. Check D<br>
<br>
He will definitely be caught :)<br>
