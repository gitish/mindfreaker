<p>There are 5 holes arranged in a line in a park and there is a frog.<br><br>
Initially frog can be in any of the 5 holes. Next day he can jump either one hole to the right or one hole to the left
For extreme positions, he will jump only to its valid location. <br><br>E.g. - for extreme right, he can only jump to its left.
<br><br>You do not know its initial position. Each day you can put our hand in any one hole and check for the frog. If itâ€™s not there, then you can check again next day.
Now, you have to devise the strategy to catch the frog in finite number of days. <br><br>Give the possible orders in which you will check the holes each day and the minimum number of days in which you will be able to catch the frog definitely. (Strategy & number of days together will be considered as right answer)
