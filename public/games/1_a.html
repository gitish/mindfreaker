<p>The prince was wearing white hat.</p>

Logic: Let three princes are A,B and C.
We know that B and C are wearing white hats, and I am A.
<p>
If I wore black hat, then B would think this way :-
Since A wore black, C would have guessed the color of his hat if I too wore a black hat, but C didn’t respond hence I must be wearing a WHITE hat.
Hence B would have guessed his hat color this way, but since this didn’t happen, A must not be wearing a black hat and hence a White hat.
